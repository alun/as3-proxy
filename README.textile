h1. How to use

# Install apparat and scala 2.8.0 (see http://code.google.com/p/apparat/ for instructions)
# Clone this repo
# Setup APPARAT_HOME env variable to point to apparat jars dir.
# Build the tool with ./build.sh
# Make conversion ./run.sh path/to/swc proxy, this will modify swc in place

As a result you'll get modified swc which will call a Hook.as proxy class every time when it were call addEventListener before.
